There are two approaches to this exercise:
 1) echoing character-by-character
 2) echoing line-by-line

In main.c, I have labeled each of the two while loops
corresponding to these approaches. The book invites
you to test your code using cat to send an entire
file out to the tty, then capturing the output in
another file, then diffing the two files. For both
approaches, you can do this using two terminals:

- In terminal 1, run to capture output:

$ sudo cat /dev/ttyUSB0 > out.txt

- In terminal 2, run to send input:

$ sudo sh -c 'cat input.txt > /dev/ttyUSB0'

- Send kill signal in terminal 1 (Ctrl + C).
- Diff the files ($ diff input.txt output.txt).

I used InputToPipe.txt and created the two
corresponding Out*.txt files in this manner. Make
sure to use the correct tty, as yours may be named
differently.

As the author noted, my OutLineByLine.txt file differed
in places from the original input file; this difference
changed between most runs. I didn't see any differences
with char-by-char echoing.
